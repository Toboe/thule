<p>A while back in my Environmental Science class we were talking about 
hurricanes. My teacher asked this really sIutty girl what some of the effects

Suddenly the quietest guy in class looks up and goes, &quot;Megan, no one asked 
about your weekend.&quot; Never have I laughed so hard in my life. MLIA
