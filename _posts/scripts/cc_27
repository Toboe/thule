Title: Use wbinfo to output a table with basic user information from the default domain controller.

$ READ DESCRIPTION (Function too long)

This function uses 'wbinfo' with 'column' to output a table with the User, 
Username and Primary Group from the default Domain Controller. Very useful if 
you work with Samba/Winbind. You can add grep at the end to filter groups.

The function is:

for ADUSER in $(wbinfo -u); do UINFO=$(wbinfo -i "$ADUSER" | cut -d ":" -f3); 
GINFO=$(wbinfo -i "$ADUSER" | cut -d ":" -f4); SIDU=$(wbinfo -U "$UINFO"); 
SIDG=$(wbinfo -G "$GINFO"); USERID=$(wbinfo -s "$SIDU" | sed 's/.\{1\}$//' | 
cut -d "+" -f2); GROUPID=$(wbinfo -s "$SIDG" | sed 's/.\{1\}$//' | cut -d "+" 
-f2); echo -e "$ADUSER":"$USERID":"$GROUPID"; done | column -tx -s:
Title: Viewable terminal session over network.

$ mkfifo /tmp/view; nc -l 9876 <> /tmp/view& script -f /tmp/view

connect to it with any network command (including web browser - if you don't 
mind weird formatting)

curl 127.0.0.1:9876

nc 127.0.0.1 9876
Title: wmic search systems for running 'exe' to hijack migrate

$ FOR /F "delims==" %%A IN ('type ips.txt') DO wmic /Node:%%A wmic 
/user:username /password:yourpassword /FAILFAST:ON process where "name like 
'%.exe'" call getowner

This is used during pentest to quickly poll all the processes running on a set 
of systems you have common credentials for the /FAILFAST:ON speeds up the 
scans.
