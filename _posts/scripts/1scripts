I find this useful for just quickly seeing which files contain a search time. I would normally limit the files searched with a command such as :
find . -iname '*php' | xargs grep 'string' -sl

Another common search for me, is to just look at the recently updated files:
find . -iname '*php' -mtime -1 | xargs grep 'string' -sl

would find only files edited today, whilst the following finds the files older than today:
find . -iname '*php' -mtime +1 | xargs grep 'string' -sl
