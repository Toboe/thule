heroku keys:clear
heroku keys:add
So it looks to me like the git is using /Users/bishopz/.ssh keys rather than the keys I generated manually inside the repository folder.

In addition to the answers below, this article seems to be providing a lot of insight: Cannot push to Heroku because key fingerprint

I tried completely removing the .ssh directory. I ran

heroku keys:clear
ssh-add -D #to remove all ssh identities
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "email@gmail.com" -f  ~/.ssh/id_rsa_heroku
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_heroku
heroku keys:add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_heroku.pub
git push heroku master
and now get:
