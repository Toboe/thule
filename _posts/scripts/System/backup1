Cloning a partition
From physical disk /dev/sda, partition 1, to physical disk /dev/sdb, partition 1.
dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1 bs=4096 conv=notrunc,noerror
If output file of (sdb1 in the example) does not exist, dd will start at the beginning of the disk and create it.
Cloning an entire hard disk
From physical disk /dev/sda to physical disk /dev/sdb
dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=4096 conv=notrunc,noerror
This will clone the entire drive, including MBR (and therefore bootloader), all partitions, UUIDs, and data.
notrunc or 'do not truncate' maintains data integrity by instructing dd not to truncate any data.
noerror instructs dd to continue operation, ignoring all input errors. Default behavior for dd is to halt at any error.
bs=4096 sets the block size to 4k, an optimal size for hard disk read/write efficiency and therefore, cloning speed.
Note: To regain unique UUIDs, use "tune2fs /dev/sdbX -U random" on every partitions.
