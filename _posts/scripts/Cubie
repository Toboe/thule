Try running and press the button.
acpi_listen
If you see button events like "button/power PBTN 00000080 00000000" then it's needed to configure the acpi daemon.

Add an event listener to /etc/acpi/events by creating a file with the following content:
event=button/power
action=/etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh %e
Then create the appropriate script /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh and implement the desired functionality.


root@cubieboard2:/dev# acpi
acpi_listen  acpid        
root@cubieboard2:/dev# acpi_listen 
button/power PBTN 00000080 00000000
