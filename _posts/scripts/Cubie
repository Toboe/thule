1 In your PC, create folder (for example CubieboardFiles) in your linux-pc.
2 Make sure you have installed git command (sudo apt-get install git). Then type in terminal:

Code: [Select]
~/CubieboardFiles$ git clone git://github.com/linux-sunxi/sunxi-boards.git
~/CubieboardFiles$ git clone git://github.com/linux-sunxi/sunxi-tools.git
~/CubieboardFiles$ cp sunxi-boards/sys_config/a10/cubieboard.fex sunxi-tools
~/CubieboardFiles$ cd sunxi-tools
~/CubieboardFiles$ make

3 Mount first partition of your cubie micro-sd card  (/dev/mmcblk0p1), it should appear already mounted in /media/. Then search in the root of that partition and copy your script.bin file of your cubie in the PC folder /CubieboardFile/sunxi-tools 
4 Go to folder /CubieboardFile/sunxi-tools 

5 Type in terminal

Code: [Select]
./fexc -vq -I bin -O fex script.bin cubie.fex

6 Open (gedit, leafpad, libreoffice, whatever) cubie.fex file.
7 Where there is 

 
screen0_output_mode = 4

Write 

screen0_output_mode = X

Being X:

 
0   for 480i    
1   for 576i    
2   for 480p    
3   for 576p    
4   for 720p50    
5   for 720p60    
6   for 1080i50    
7   for 1080i60   
8   for 1080p24   
9   for 1080p50   
10   for 1080p60    
11   for pal    
14   for ntsc   

8 Save changes.

9 Type in terminal

Code: [Select]
./fexc -vq -I fex -O bin cubie.fex script.bin

(if it asks you if replace the existing file: yes)

10 Copy the file script.bin back to the cubie, replacing the existing one (don't worry, I'm almost sure about what I'm doing)

11 Reboot

Congratulations¡¡¡

Try running and press the button.
acpi_listen
If you see button events like "button/power PBTN 00000080 00000000" then it's needed to configure the acpi daemon.

Add an event listener to /etc/acpi/events by creating a file with the following content:
event=button/power
action=/etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh %e
Then create the appropriate script /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh and implement the desired functionality.


root@cubieboard2:/dev# acpi
acpi_listen  acpid        
root@cubieboard2:/dev# acpi_listen 
button/power PBTN 00000080 00000000

Broadcast message from root@cubieboard2 (Thu Jan  1 18:08:22 1970):

Power button pressed 
The system is going down for system halt NOW!
