Let`s consider "How I can get stats for my /dev/hda3 ??"
Let`s consider this line : 3 3 hda3 20498 4272886 1229274 9834168
After a word "hda3" we have four 32-bit (type integer) fields, us interesting these: 
The second field: 4272886 (total number of sectors which normally reads from /dev/hda3)
and The Fourth filed : 9834168 (total number of sectors which normally writes to /dev/hda3)
These two fields - all that is necessary for us. A /proc/diskstats continuously updated and all that is necessary for us - make measurements for "second field" and "fourth field" in two different moment of time, receiving a difference of values and dividing it into an interval of time, we shall have Disk I/O stats in sectors/sec. Multiply this result on 512 (number of bytes in one sector) we shall have Disk I/O stats in bytes/sec. 
May be exist a problem how to measure precisely moment of a time in seconds ... 
Here a piece of my code on ะก for this purpose:
